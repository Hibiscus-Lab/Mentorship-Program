# Organization Admins
If you need help with anything mentoring at Hibiscus Lab, you can file an issue at this repo or reach out to us using the Discussions boards.
Organization admins for specific mentorship programs are listed on the program's respective pages.

# Communication
Please reach out to us using the Discussions boards.

We are also available on the Hibiscus Lab slack. Please don't use DMs unless strictly necessary as doing so both has the potential of overwhelming project maintainers and others with similar questions lose the benefit of public discussion.

It's best if you use a public communication channel whenever possible; however, if you need to communicate in private, please feel free to send the admins a note via hello@biscus.my (please use the public channels for any project-related discussion).
